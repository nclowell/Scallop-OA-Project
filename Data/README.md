# Data Directory

This directory stores the water chemistry data for the experiment. This data includes the Durafet probe real-time readings to the Avtech system, daily TRIS calibration data of the bench-top pH probe, and pH, temperature, and salinity tests per day.

Water samples killed with mercuric chloride were taken every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the experiment.

The tissue sample data is not stored here because they have not been processed yet. The four populations and the number of animals in each population were:

<br>Catalina, CA: 27
<br>Quilcene, WA: 23
<br>Sekiu, WA: 29
<br>Seward, AK: 13
