## About this experiment ##

I split four populations of rock scallops (Crassadoma gigantea) into two pH treatments - ambient pH and low pH. I sampled them at Time Zero, before we set the low pH treatment on, then after 48 hours with the treatment on, and in a few more weeks I'll sample them one more time. In collaboration with another graduate student, I collected samples for RNAseq, proteomics, lipid analysis, microbial communities, and shell strength.
