## About this repository ##

This repository is for storing the water chemistry data and research plan for the rock scallop ocean acidification project.

## About this experiment ##

The purpose of this project is to investigate whether there are population differences between physiological response to low pH stress in rock scallops. In collaboration with Puget Sound Restoration Fund, we built an ocean acidification water treatment system. The system worked by filtering inflow seawater from Manchester, Washington, and then adjusting the pH with a solenoid valve connected to a CO2 tank. As the pH increased above a threshold, a Durafet probe in the header tank would signal the valve to open, causing an increase in CO2 and a decrease in pH. Each header tank recirculatedWe collected four populations of rock scallops (*Crassadoma gigantea*) for purposes of a different study, and used them here. That is why the population sizes are quite small. Therefore, this project may be redirected to be a species-level investigation into the physiological response to low pH in rock scallops.

We split four populations of rock scallops (Crassadoma gigantea) into two pH treatments - ambient pH and low pH. All animals were acclimated to the ambient pH treatment for a week, then half of the animals were exposed to a low pH treatment. We sampled them at Time Zero, before we set the low pH treatment on, then after 48 hours with the treatment on, and then eight weeks later. In collaboration with other graduate students, we collected samples for RNA, proteins, lipids, microbial communities, and shell strength. Another graduate student included Olympia oysters in my tanks, and sampled for RNA, with the hopes of a comparison paper.

Water chemistry was monitored in real-time with a Durafet probes reading to an avtech system in the two header tanks storing the treated water (both low pH and ambient pH), which were calibrated in a TRIS solution prior to the start of the experiment. Three days a week, a benchtop pH probe was recalibrated using the same TRIS solution, and measurements of pH, salinity, and temperature of each replicate tub (four tubs per treatment) and each header tank were taken. In addition, a water sample was collected and killed with mercuric chloride for measuring total alkalinity.

## Water Chemistry Data

The water chemistry data has three parts. The first is the avtech data ouptut of the Durafet probes, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/nclowell/Scallop-OA-Project/tree/master/Data/avtech). The second is the bench top probe TRIS calibrations that were taken three times a week, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/nclowell/Scallop-OA-Project/tree/master/Data/TRIScalibs). And lastly, the pH, salinity, and temperature probes that were taken three times a week, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/nclowell/Scallop-OA-Project/tree/master/Data/SW.chem.dps).

## Sample Inventory

I collected tissue samples from five tissue types and stored them in RNALater:
- ctenidia
- gonad
- gut
- abductor muscle
- mantle

These samples are time sensitive in RNALater and need to be processed in the near future. They are currently stored in a -20 freezer, and are expected to last up to a year according to the RNALater information. Sampling dates were in October and November, so the samples will survive until the end of 2017.
