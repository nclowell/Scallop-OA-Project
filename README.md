## About this experiment ##

The purpose of this project was to investigate whether there are population differences between physiological response to low pH stress in rock scallops. In collaboration with Puget Sound Restoration Fund, we built an ocean acidification water treatment system. We collected four populations of rock scallops (*Crassadoma gigantea*) for purposes of a different study, and used them here. That is why the population sizes are quite small. Therefore, this project may be redirected to be a species-level investigation into the physiological response to low pH in rock scallops.

We split four populations of rock scallops (Crassadoma gigantea) into two pH treatments - ambient pH and low pH. All animals were acclimated to the ambient pH treatment for a week, then exposed half of the animals to a low pH treatment. We sampled them at Time Zero, before we set the low pH treatment on, then after 48 hours with the treatment on, and in a few more weeks I'll sample them one more time after six weeks. In collaboration with another graduate student, I collected samples for RNAseq, proteomics, lipid analysis, microbial communities, and shell strength. A separate graduate student included Olympia oysters in my tanks, with the hopes of a joint study.
